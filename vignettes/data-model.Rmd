## The traj database model

### General remarks
It is possible, but not recommended, to add extra columns to the tables to store
additional information. For example to preserve the old, non-integer burst IDs
additionally to the burst names (*b_name*), and also create new burst IDs (*b_id*),
the user might want to add a column to store the old burst IDs (e.g. *b_old_id*).
Note that although the columns with "_id" use auto-incrementing integers, it is
possible to provide own integer values for these columns. Also note that
additional information about the data can be provided in the infolocs tables,
which is the the recommended procedure. See further at the table description. 

The default schema name is **traj**, and can store as many pgtrajes as needed.
Also there can be any number of pgtraj schemas to store pgtrajes. Therefore all
functions default to schema **traj**, but the user can change the target schema.

It is possible to modify steps and bursts. The procedure in this case is to
create a new step or burst and delete the old one.

### Storing geometries in PostGIS
PostGIS stores spatial data in either *geometry* or *geography* data types. The key difference between the two is that the *geometry* type is based on the Cartesian grid, while the *geography* type is based on the WGS 84 lon/lat SRID 4326 geodetic coordinate reference system (CRS)[^1]. In order to accurately calculate parameters in trajectories that span accross large areas and have steps of tens of kilometers long, the earth cannot be considered in two dimensions, and the data must be appropriately projected. Hence the *geography* type seems to be the obvious choice to store the relocation and step geometries in the database. Unfortunately, as of PostGIS 2.2, only a limited selection of functions support the *geography* type[^2], and many of the *geometry-only* functions are used to calculate the step parameters. 

The R object class *ltraj* assumes that the coordinates stored in the object are projected and their projection is known. However, in many cases the projection is not known or ignored, therefore the data should be treated as unprojected. Because the *geography* type stores the data in the WGS 84 lon/lat CRS, this case cannot be handled and assuming the WGS 84 projection for each dataset would be clearly erroneous.

### Managing projections in PostGIS and R
From `adehabitat` version 0.3.21 an *ltraj* object stores the projection of the relocations in
its *proj4string* attribute. The function `ltraj2pgtraj` tries to find the 
matching SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier) in the PostGIS database by using
`rpostgis::pgSRID`, and if found, uses the SRID for creating geometries. 
The *pgtraj* table stores the original *proj4string* so it can be
restored by `pgtraj2ltraj`.

### Managing time zones in PostgreSQL and R
In PostgreSQL all timezone-aware dates and times are stored internally in UTC.
For display they are converted to local time in the zone specified on the server. Therefore
the time zone of the input *ltraj* is stored in the *pgtraj* table's *time_zone*
field in order to restore the *ltraj* with the original time zone when using
`pgtraj2ltraj`.

This also means that if for some reason the user lives in The Hague (NL), has the dates in his ltraj in EST (e.g. "2003-05-31 17:00:56 EST"), puts the ltraj into the database, then for the same date they will see "2003-06-01 00:00:56" in the database, because the date is displayed in CEST (his local time zone), however internally it is stored in UTC.

**A note on managing time zones in R:**
Care must be taken when changing the time zone of a POSIXt object in R. 
Consider the following example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(adehabitatLT)
data(ibexraw)
attr(ibexraw[[1]]$date, "tzone")
# [1] "Europe/Paris"
ibexraw[[1]][1, "date"]
# [1] "2003-06-01 00:00:56 CEST"
format(ibexraw[[1]][1, "date"], tz="America/Florida", usetz=TRUE)
# [1] "2003-05-31 22:00:56 America"
```

Notice that the time zone 'America/Florida' is **not valid**, as it is not in the
system's time zone database. Therefore the dates are assumed to be in the 
standard time zone (UTC) and no warning is given. To check the valid time
zone names in your system use `OlsonNames()`[^3].
