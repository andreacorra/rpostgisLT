## Motivation for the package and relation to adehabitatLT

## The pgtraj database model

### General remarks
It is possible, but not recommended, to add extra columns to the tables to store
additional information. For example to preserve the old, non-integer burst IDs
additionally to the burst names (b_name), and also create new burst IDs (b_id),
the user might want to add a column to store the old burst IDs (e.g. b_old_id).
Note that although the columns *_id use auto-incrementing integers, it is
possible to provide own integer values for these columns. Also note that
additional information about the data can be provided in the infolocs tables,
which the the recommended procedure See further at the table description. 

The default schema name is ‘pgtraj’, and can store as many pgtrajes as needed.
Also there can be any number of pgtraj schemas to store pgtrajes. Therefore all
functions default to schema ‘pgtraj’, but the user can change the target schema.

It is possible to modify steps and bursts. The procedure in this case is to
create a new step or burst and delete the old one.

### Database model

![ER diagram of the pgtraj database model](./figure/database_model.png)

**animals table**\
Contains animal names.

| Name   | Type   | Constraint       | Description                          |
|--------|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
|a_id   | serial | PK               | Auto-generated numeric ID of animal. |
|a_name | text   | Not Null, unique | Name of the animal.                  |

**bursts table**\
Contains burst information and their relation to animals. One burst can belong
only to one animal, but one animal can have many bursts.

| Name   | Type    | Constraint| Description|
|--------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| b_id   | serial  | PK | Auto-generated numeric ID of burst.| 
| b_name | text | default: animal name corresponding to the provided unique | Name or other identifier of burst.             |  
| a_id  | integer | FK| ID ofthe animal that made the burst. Pointing to the entry in animals table. |

**infolocs table**\
Contains additional information on steps. Mirrors the infolocs attribute of an ltraj object.

| Name    | Type   | Constraint | Description                                          |
|---------|--------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| i_id    | serial | PK         | Auto-generated numeric ID of infoloc.                |
| infoloc | json   |            | Contains the additional information encoded in JSON. |

**pgtrajs table**\
Groups of trajectories, with unique names. Groups can be defined on any criteria, e.g. steps belonging to one ltraj object can form a group, thus belong under one pgtraj.

| Name    | Type   | Constraint       | Description                                      |
|---------|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| p_id    | serial | PK               | Auto-generated numeric ID of pgtraj.             |
| p_name  | text   | Not Null, unique | Name or other identifier of trajectory group.    |
| r_proj  | text   |                  | Projection string of the ltraj, imported from R. |
| comment | text   |                  |                                                  |

**p_b_rel table**\
Relates pgtraj and burst. The exact same burst (ID and name) can belong to many pgtrajs, as well as a pgtraj can contain many bursts.

| Name | Type    | Constraint       | Description                             |
|------|---------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| p_id | integer | PK, FK, Not Null | Pointing to the entry in pgtrajs table. |
| b_id | integer | PK, FK, Not Null | Pointing to the entry in bursts table.  |

**steps table**\
Steps and their first relocations.

| Name      | Type        | Constraint    | Description                                                                                                           |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| s_id      | serial      | PK            | Auto-generated numeric ID of step. Equal to the ID of the first of the two successive relocations that form the step. |
| r_rowname | text        | default: Null | Row name in the ltraj. This value is used for backward referencing between pgtraj and ltraj.                          |
| reloc1    | geometry    | default: Null | Geometry of the first relocation in a step. POINT                                                                     |
| step      | geometry    | default: Null | Geometry of the step. LINESTRING                                                                                      |
| date      | timestamptz | default: Null | Timestamp of the first of the two successive locations that form the step.                                            |
| dt        | interval    | default: Null | Duration of the step.                                                                                                 |

**s_i_b_rel table**\
Relates step, infoloc and burst. The exact same step (ID) can belong to many bursts, as well as a burst can contain many steps. One step–burst pair can relate to only one infoloc entry. So (step1, burst-A) relates to infoloc1, but it is possible that (step1, burst-B) relates to infoloc2.

| Name | Type    | Constraint       | Description                              |
|------|---------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| s_id | integer | PK, FK, Not Null | Pointing to the entry in steps table.    |
| i_id | integer | FK, Not Null     | Pointing to the entry in infolocs table. |
| b_id | integer | PK, FK, Not Null | Pointing to the entry in bursts table.   |
