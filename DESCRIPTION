Description: The 'rpostgisLT' package develops the integration of R
    and PostGIS for managing movement trajectories. The focus is on
    streamlining the workflow for biologists to store and process
    animal trajectories in PostGIS and analyze them in R, thus
    utilizing the strengths of both software. The package relies on
    'ltraj' objects from the R package 'adehabitatLT', and provides
    the analogous 'pgtraj' data structure in PostGIS, with all
    functions to create and manage 'pgtraj' data, and convert from and
    to both format ('pgtraj' in PostGIS, 'ltraj' in R).
