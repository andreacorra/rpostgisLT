Description: The 'rpostgisLT' package develops the integration of R
    and 'PostGIS' for managing movement trajectories. The focus is on
    streamlining the work flow for biologists to store and process
    animal trajectories in 'PostGIS' and analyze them in R, thus
    utilizing the strengths of both software. The package relies on
    'ltraj' objects from the R package 'adehabitatLT', and provides
    the analogous 'pgtraj' data structure in 'PostGIS', with all
    functions to create and manage 'pgtraj' data, and convert from and
    to both formats ('pgtraj' in 'PostGIS', 'ltraj' in R).
