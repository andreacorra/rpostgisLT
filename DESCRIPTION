Description: The project develops the integration of R and PostGIS for managing
    movement trajectories. The focus is on streamlining the workflow for biologists
    to store and process animal trajectories in PostGIS and analyze these in R, thus
    utilizing the strengths of both software. Therefore the main outcome is a new
    R package rpostgisLT, which will simplify the processing of location datasets
    into trajectories in PostGIS and provide full integration with the R package
    adehabitatlt data type ltraj.
